/***
 * The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help create maintainable, scalable, and testable software.
 * SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design Principles and Design Patterns.”
 *
 * Why do Design Principles matter?
 * Encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.
 * As applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches.
 * Software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and refactor.
 *
 * Why SOLID?
 * As a software developer, we always need to deal with changes in requirements or a new feature in the middle of development or some extension on a feature in the maintenance phase.
 * It is important to write code that’s easy to extend and maintain and make our life less painful.
 * SOLID is a set of rules that guide us on how to achieve that in object-oriented programming.
 * Using SOLID guidelines, you can avoid bad design in your code and give a well-structured architecture to your design.
 * Bad design leads to the inflexible and brittle codebase, a simple and small change can result in bugs with bad design.
 *
 * SOLID is an acronym of five sets of principles.
 * Following are the five concepts that make up SOLID principles:
 * Single Responsibility principle
 * Open/Closed principle
 * Liskov Substitution principle
 * Interface Segregation principle
 * Dependency Inversion principle.
