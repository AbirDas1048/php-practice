 * The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help create maintainable, scalable, and testable software.
 * SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design Principles and Design Patterns.”
 *
 * Why do Design Principles matter?
 * Encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.
 * As applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches.
 * Software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and refactor.
