/***
 * The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
 * In addition, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
 * This principle encourages the use of interfaces and dependency injection to decouple components and improves flexibility.
 * This principle aims to decouple high-level modules (which provide complex functionality) from low-level modules (which provide basic functionality) by introducing an abstraction layer between them.
 * This allows both high-level and low-level modules to depend on abstractions rather than on solid implementations, making the system more flexible, extensible, and maintainable.
 * According to this principle, higher level classes should not directly depend on lower level classes but abstractions.
 * It means that a higher level class should not need to know the implementation details of the low-level class, the low-level class should be hidden behind an abstraction.
