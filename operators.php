    List of operators and name

    1) Arithmetic Operators: 
        + (Addition),
        - (Subtraction),
        * (Multiplication),
        / (Division),
        % (Modulus),
        ** (Exponentiation or power)
    2) Assignment Operators: 
        = (Direct assign),
        += (Addition then assign),
        -= (Subtraction then assign),
        *= (Multiplication then assign),
        /= (Division then assign),
        %= (Modulus then assign)
    3) Comparison Operators:
        == (Equal),
        === (Identical),
        != (Not equal),
        <> (Not equal),
        !== (Not identical),
        > (Greater than),
        < (Less than),
        >= (Greater than or equal to),
        <= (Less than or equal to),
        <=> (Spaceship)
            Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero, depending on if $x is less than, equal to, or greater than $y. Introduced in PHP 7.
    4) Increment / Decrement Operators
        ++$x (Pre-increment),
        $x++ (Post-increment),
        --$x (Pre-decrement),
        $x-- (Post-decrement),
    5) Logical Operators
        and (And),
        or (Or),
        xor (Xor),
        && (And),
        || (Or),
        ! (Not)
